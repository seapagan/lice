# Future Ideas for the project

<!-- - All improvements and ideas I have had so far have been implemented in the -->
<!--   project. I'm always open to new ideas and improvements, so if you have any -->
<!--   suggestions, please let me know. -->
- Add option for `--licenses` and perhaps `--languages` to output in `JSON`
format for integration in other tools. Maybe also an option on the root command
to output both combined.
