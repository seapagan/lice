# Future Ideas for the project

<!-- - All improvements and ideas I have had so far have been implemented in the -->
<!--   project. I'm always open to new ideas and improvements, so if you have any -->
<!--   suggestions, please let me know. -->
- add an api so that other tools can use the license generation functionality
  without having to shell out to the command line
- add a GUI for the license generation (use Textual for this). This would be
  accessed through a CLI option or a config file setting.
